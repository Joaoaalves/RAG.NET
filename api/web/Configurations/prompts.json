Express a Single Fact: Each proposition should state one specific fact or claim.\n    2. Be Understandable Without Context: The proposition should be self-contained, meaning it can be understood without needing additional context.\n    3. Use Full Names, Not Pronouns: Avoid pronouns or ambiguous references; use full entity names.\n    4. Include Relevant Dates/Qualifiers: If applicable, include necessary dates, times, and qualifiers to make the fact precise.\n    5. Contain One Subject-Predicate Relationship: Focus on a single subject and its corresponding action or attribute, without conjunctions or multiple clauses.",
