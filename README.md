# RAG.NET - Under Development

RAG.NET is a modular system designed to execute Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, allowing configurable workflows for text embedding, retrieval, and ranking tasks.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core** - Backend API
- **Angular** - Web user interface
- **PostgreSQL** - Relational database
- **QDrant** - Vector database for semantic search
- **Docker** - Containerized deployment and execution

## ðŸ’» How to Run the Project

Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine.

### Run project on Development using:

```bash
docker compose -f "./docker-compose.dev" up --build
```

or

```bash
docker-compose -f "./docker-compose.dev" up --build
```

### Build the project using:
